An extension for purists, to watch YouTube videos without OSD during play. 
Remove the title, the centered play & pause icons & the More videos arrow of the YouTube player.
Hide the pointer after 1/2 second & the controls panel if not pointed.

If there is a video ad before, pause here to remove the pause icon.
